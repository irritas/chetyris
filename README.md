Getting Started

The goal of the game is to complete a goal number of lines within the alloted time. Each new level the max time decreases and the target lines increases.

Three new blocks are introduced: the crazy, the foam, and the vapor. The crazy block acts as any other block. The foam block will fill in all connected open spaces in a 5x5 area. The vapor will delete all blocks in a 5x5 area.
